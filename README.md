## Hello 🌟
I’m **Jennifer Collins**, working in cybersecurity with a focus on incident response, threat detection, and secure system design. My background in restaurant hospitality taught me the value of teamwork, adaptability, and building strong relationships—skills I now apply to help organizations strengthen their cybersecurity defenses. I love learning *all the things*—whether it’s about technology, problem-solving, or just something fun and unexpected!

## About Me
- 🎓 I hold an Associate of Applied Science in Cybersecurity from Ozarks Technical Community College and am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University.
- 🛡️ I focus on helping small and medium-sized businesses defend against evolving cyber threats while building lasting partnerships.
- 🌐 I’m active in the local tech community as a member of Springfield Tech Council, Springfield Devs, & Springfield Women in Tech.
- 🧠 I enjoy mentoring others through hands-on labs and Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.

## Outside of Tech
When I’m not working on cybersecurity projects, I enjoy:
- Playing mini-golf ⛳  
- Birding 🐦  
- Exploring trails 🚶‍♀️🌲
